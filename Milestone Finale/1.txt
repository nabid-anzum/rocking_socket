I first collect some user experience. Basically it comes from my friends. I make a simple survey on their choices about the app. The I 
designed a simple GUI using drag and drop aoption of NetBeans. I made it super simple. There two page only server and client. When server 
is started app is ON. client can request for connection. If space is available then server will connect a client. the messages will appear
on the big text form. Below that there is a option for sending messages. Thats my GUI for this app.
