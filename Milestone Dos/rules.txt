(These rules are for this demo application. Rules can be changed later.)
  1. I made a simple GUI for this demo application.
  2. This application will work like a group conversation in messanger.
  3. Application will start when server is ON.
  4. WHen a user will send a message every connected users can see the message.
  5. Only 5 users can join simultenously.
  6. When the sixth user will request access he will be sent to waiting list.
  7. In waiting list sixth user can observe the servers status but cannot participate in conversation.
  8. The later requests will be accepted if the thread becomes free.
  9. Any user can disconnect from the server anytime.
  10. This is when the thread will be free.
  11. Users can see how many users are there in online(connected).
  
  
  
  
Thats all for now
